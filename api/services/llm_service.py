Great question about trees! Here's an explanation of Binary Search Trees:

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a hierarchical data structure where:
- Each node has at most two children (left and right)
- Left child contains values smaller than the parent
- Right child contains values larger than the parent

This property makes search operations efficient - O(log n) on average.

**Key Operations:**
- **Search**: Compare target with node, go left or right accordingly
- **Insert**: Find correct position, add new leaf
- **Delete**: Three cases - no children, one child, or two children

Would you like me to show code examples for any of these operations?""",
        
        "graph": f"""{file_info}

Excellent question about graphs! Let me explain:

A **Graph** consists of:
- **Vertices (V)**: Nodes representing entities
- **Edges (E)**: Connections between vertices

**Types:**
- **Directed** vs Undirected
- **Weighted** vs Unweighted
- **Cyclic** vs Acyclic

**Common Representations:**
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

**Key Algorithms:**
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) - Level by level traversal
- DFS (Depth-First Search) - Go deep before backtracking
- Dijkstra's Algorithm - Shortest path in weighted graphs

Which specific graph topic would you like to explore further?""",
        
        "algorithm": f"""{file_info}

Algorithms are fundamental to computer science! Here are key concepts:

**Time Complexity (Big O):**
- O(1) - Constant
- O(log n) - Logarithmic  
- O(n) - Linear
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic
- O(n²) - Quadratic

**Space Complexity:**
- How much memory the algorithm needs

**Common Patterns:**
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
